I earned my dual bachelor's degrees in Telematics and Computer Engineering at Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (ITAM). I obtained my M.S.in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC). I am currently a Networked Systems Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine. My research interest focuses on edge computing, 5G NR networks, control and reinforcement learning applies to the optimization of resouce allocation in heterogeneous networks.
