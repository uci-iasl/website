# The text between the '---' lines at the top of this file defines the

#
# The metadata are formatted in YAML, with a small subset of its
# syntax used. Format your information the same way it is done
# for the exemplary data below.
#
# Do not copy the lines starting with '#' (like this one) into your
# file; those are just comments.
#
# Full name, e.g., 'Firstname Lastname' or 'Firstname M. Lastname'.
# Write it the same way you would in a paper.

I obtained my Bachelor and Master degree in University of Padova, Italy, in Computer Engineering.
I am now a Computer Science Ph.D Student at University of California Irvine, working on Machine Learning in an heterogeneous Computer System. I focus on how to make Sensor Networks more reliable and efficient through architecture design, studying and implementing real systems.
Since the participation to the DARPA HackFest 2017, in joint team guided by Prof. Levorato and Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari, teaching at USC Viterbi School of Engineering, I have been using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) as an application of my studies.
These devices, characterized by high mobility, time limitations and limited energy availability, offer a great opportunity for researching my topics of interest.
