I obtained my Bachelor and Master degree in University of Padova, Italy, in Computer Engineering. 

I am now a Computer Science Ph.D Student at University of California Irvine, working on Machine Learning in heterogeneous Computer Systems. I focus on how to make Sensor Networks more reliable and efficient through architecture design, studying and implementing real-time systems.

Since the participation to the DARPA HackFest 2017, in joint team guided by Prof. Levorato and Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari, teaching at USC Viterbi School of Engineering, I have been using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) as an application of my studies.
These devices, characterized by high mobility, time constraints and limited energy availability, offer a great opportunity for researching my topics of interest.

### TA and mentorship

I helped delivering high quality courses in UC Irvine during A.Y.s 2016-17 and 2017-18, helping as a Teaching Assistant in *Intermediate Python (ICS 33)*, *Introduction to Machine Learning (CS 173a)*, *Computer and Commincation Networks (CS 132-232)* (both undergraduate and graduate level).

During my time as a graduate student, I mentored more than 20 undergraduate and graduate students, leading undergraduate research projects and senior projects that won 4 Undergraduate Research Awards (collettively more than $4000).
I also mentored 3 graduate students: one master thesis project, two visiting and joining our research group (who joined the Ph.D program in UC Irvine).

<!-- My research contributed securing funding opportunities for our laboratory through awards from DARPA and NSF. -->

### Other

I collaborated with [Igor Burago](https://iasl.ics.uci.edu/people/iburago/) creating and maintaing this website 2018-2021.
