I receieved my M.Sc. (Tech.) degree is in Information Technology, from the Department of Information Technology and Communication Systems, University of Turku, Finland in 2013. My major was on “Networked Systems Security” and minor was on “Cryptography”.

I am currently working toward my Ph.D. degree at the Department of Future Technologies, University of Turku, Finland. Since December 2016, I am also a visiting research scholar at University of California, Irvine, Department of Comuter Science, Intelligence and Autonomous Systems Lab., under the direct supervison of [__*Prof. Marco Levorato*__](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlevorat/).

My technical abilities have been in the field of scalable and lightweight security for IoT systems. I have extensively worked on Peer Authentication and Authorization, Key Management Systems, and Secure End-to-End Communication on which I have received several research excellence awards including twice from Nokia foundation in Finland (2014 and 2016). The application domain to which I have been applying my techniques is e-health, however my proposed solutions are not limited to this application domain and are rather generic.

I have leaded several academic and industrial projects. I have been co-advising several M.Sc. theses as well as leading my own research in Finland and the USA. Before starting my MSc, I successfully leaded several computer network projects as the project manager where I was responsible for administration of network and server infrastructure within all departments, managing our team of IT professionals, implementing technology security and executing several technology-related tasks and initiatives. I am known to be disciplined and an excellent team worker.
