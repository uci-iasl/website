During my Master studies, I've got the opportunity to design data networks using real Cisco equipments at DePaul University networking lab. In my Master's final project, I have designed a comprehensive network architecture for delay-sensitive applications with dual-homed data centers. In my design, I was able to prove (by experiment in the lab) how my fault-tolerance strategies can keep the network stable even when multiple parts of the network fail at the same time. My experience at the lab gave me a good insight on how ISPs design and operate their networks.

Prior to attending UCI, I worked at STC, a major telecommunications company located in Saudi Arabia. I was assigned to the Packet-Core Network Section under Network Control & Architecture department where we (as a team) evaluate, design, and propose technical solutions to the ISP's core level of the PS network, as well as oversee all ongoing projects in the PS network.

Currently at UCI, I am investigating the communication scenarios between vehicles cruising down the road. There are different possible applications for vehicular networks, ranging from entertainment applications to collaborative driving of autonomous vehicles. Ultimately, road conditions are not always optimal for exchanging messages between speedy vehicles. For example, wireless signal fading due to high-rise buildings and congestion in the wireless spectrum would pose a great challenge on many vehicular applications, especially the safety-critical ones. Therefore, my current research focuses on evaluating and proposing possible solutions for enabling a reliable Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET). My current work include researching V2V and V2I limitations, ITS infrastructure support, message caching via Named-Data Network, and multi-path message delivery via multiple network interfaces (802.11p, WiFi, LTE/5G).
