I obtained my Master's degree in Network Engineering and Security from DePaul University. In my Master's final project, I designed a network architecture with multiple fault-tolerance strategies for delay-sensitive applications that require dual-homed data centers. I was able to prove (using real enterprise-grade networking equipments) how my design can keep the network stable even when multiple parts of the network fail at the same time.

I worked at STC (one of the largest telecommunications companies in the Middle East) as a network engineer in the Packet-Core Network division under Network Control & Architecture department that evaluates, designs, and proposes technical solutions to the most critical part of ISP; the core level of the PS network.

At UCI, I am a Networked System Ph.D. Candidate and my research focus on the communication networks of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, whether the vehicles are ground (i.e. cars and trucks) or aerial (i.e. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, A.K.A drones). In particular, I investigate the security and privacy aspects of such networks. Currently I am researching the methodologies for authenticating the identities of legitimate vehicles while detecting the presence of illegitimate ones via different approaches such as drone First-Person View (FPV) video analysis and optical authentication & localization.
