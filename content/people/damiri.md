I received my  B.S. from Shiraz University, Iran in Electrical Engineering.  Later on, I got my M.S. in Electrical Engineering in Signal and Image Processing at Indiana University, Purdue University, Indianapolis (IUPUI). I am now a Ph.D. Candidate at University of California Irvine, studying Electrical Engineering. My research focuses on Internet of Cognitive Things in Healthcare. I study on edge based optimization approaches as a function of contexts of a patient to control energy constraint sensors. I try to design algorithms using both accuracy of measurements in sensors and activity of an individual to build more energy efficient sensor control methods to monitor a patient for longer time while fulfilling certain levels of risk of health deterioration. Working under supervision of my advisor, Prof. Levorato and Co-advisor, Prof. Nikil Dutt at UC Irvine, I implemented edge based context-aware algorithms to control body sensors. My project is in collaboration with University of Turku, Finland and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. We implement health-care IoT for a better life.
