**Our research** focuses on fundamental computational aspects of
*autonomous systems*, broadly intended as those capable of observing
themselves and their environment to make self-governing decisions in
pursuit of high-level goals.

**Our mission** is to facilitate integration of *intelligence*,
broadly intended as the capacity to learn from and adjust to
changing conditions, in different autonomous systems ranging from
resource-constrained devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles, to
large-scale communication and computation infrastructures of the
Internet of Things and smart energy grids.

**Our goal** is to develop the mathematical foundations and
technological principles enabling these systems to productively
acquire, efficiently transport, and timely analyze information.
