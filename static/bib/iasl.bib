  abstract = {The edge computing paradigm places compute-capable devices~--- edge servers~--- at the network edge to assist mobile devices in executing data analysis tasks. Intuitively, offloading compute-intense tasks to edge servers can reduce their execution time. However, poor conditions of the wireless channel connecting the mobile devices to the edge servers may degrade the overall capture-to-output delay achieved by edge offloading. Herein, we focus on edge computing supporting remote object detection by means of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and develop a framework to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the wireless link. The core idea we propose builds on recent approaches splitting DNNs into sections~--- namely head and tail models~--- executed by the mobile device and edge server, respectively. The wireless link, then, is used to transport the output of the last layer of the head model to the edge server, instead of the DNN input. Most prior work focuses on classification tasks and leaves the DNN structure unaltered. Herein, our focus is on DNNs for three different object detection tasks, which present a much more convoluted structure, and modify the architecture of the network to: (i)~achieve in-network compression by introducing a bottleneck layer in the early layers on the head model, and (ii)~prefilter pictures that do not contain objects of interest using a convolutional neural network. Results show that the proposed technique represents an effective intermediate option between local and edge computing in a parameter region where these extreme point solutions fail to provide satisfactory performance.},

  abstract = {Following the trends of mobile and edge computing for DNN models, an intermediate option, split computing, has been attracting attentions from the research community. Previous studies empirically showed that while mobile and edge computing often would be the best options in terms of total inference time, there are some scenarios where split computing methods can achieve shorter inference time. All the proposed split computing approaches, however, focus on image classification tasks, and most are assessed with small datasets that are far from the practical scenarios. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in developing split computing methods for powerful R-CNN object detectors trained on a large dataset, COCO 2017. We extensively analyze the object detectors in terms of layer-wise tensor size and model size, and show that naive split computing methods would not reduce inference time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to inject small bottlenecks to such object detectors and unveil the potential of a split computing approach.},

  abstract = {Making Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) fully autonomous faces many challenges, some of which are connected to the inherent limitations of their on-board resources, such as energy supply, sensing capabilities, wireless characteristics, and computational power. The sensing, communication, and computation Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure surrounding the UAVs can mitigate such limitations. However, external traffic dynamics, signal propagation, and other poignant characteristics of the IoT infrastructure make it an extremely dynamic and incoherent environment, especially in urban scenarios, thus challenging the use of IoT resources for mission-critical UAV applications. Herein, the concept of information autonomy is introduced to extend autonomy to encompass how information-related tasks are handled in this challenging scenario. In this paper, we motivate the need for ``Information Autonomy'' based on our observations from real-world experiments and present a self-adaptive framework for edge-assisted UAV applications. Through our preliminary evaluation, we show that our ``Information Autonomy'' framework is capable of handling uncertainties autonomously during run-time.},

Different from prior literature presenting DNN splitting frameworks, we distill the architecture of the head DNN to reduce its computational complexity and introduce a bottleneck, thus minimizing processing load at the mobile device as well as the amount of wirelessly transferred data. Our results show 98\%~reduction in used bandwidth and 85\%~in computation load compared to straightforward splitting.},

To make time-sensitive adaptation possible in these conditions, we consider learning a decision rule that is computationally viable for on-sensor use and is continuously adjusted by the cloud using the optimal decision rule for supervision. We pose a constrained stochastic optimization problem for online learning of such instrumental on-sensor classifier, propose an algorithm for updating its parameters, and establish the conditions under which convergence to a local extremum is guaranteed, at least for samples of independent observations.},

This paper presents an edge-assisted framework, where models and control generated by an edge server inform the sensing parameters of mobile sensors. The objective is to maximize the probability that anomalies in the collected signals are detected over extensive periods of time under battery-imposed constraints. Although the proposed concept is general, the control framework is made specific to a use-case where vital signs~--- heart rate, respiration rate and oxygen saturation~--- are extracted from a Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal to detect anomalies in real-time. Experimental results show a 16.9\%~reduction in sensing energy consumption in comparison to a constant energy consumption with the maximum misdetection probability of~0.17 in a 24-hour health monitoring system.},

The limited processing speed and energy storage of these devices inevitably makes the real-time analysis of complex signals~--- the key to autonomy~--- challenging. In urban environments, the UAV can leverage the communication and computation resources of the surrounding city-wide Internet of Things infrastructure to enhance their capabilities. For instance, the UAVs can interconnect with edge computing resources and offload computation task to improve response time to sensor input and reduce energy consumption. However, the complexity of the urban topology and the large number of devices and data streams competing for the same network and computation resources create an extremely dynamic environment, where poor channel conditions and edge server congestion may penalize the performance of task offloading. This paper develops a framework enabling optimal offloading decisions as a function of network and computation load parameters and current state. The optimization is formulated as an optimal stopping time problem over a Markov process.},

They are usually based on the signal strength of a device packet received by a set of WiFi access points. Among the most precise solutions, are those based on machine learning algorithms, such as kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors). This technique is known as fingerprint positioning. Even though kNN is one of the most used classification methods due to its high precision results, it lacks scalability since an instance we need to classify must be compared to all other instances in the training base. In this work, we use a novel hierarchical navigable small world graph technique to fit the training database so that the samples can be efficiently classified in the online phase of the fingerprint positioning, allowing it to be used in large-scale scenarios and/or to be executed in resource-limited devices. We evaluated the performance of this solution using both synthetic and real-world training data and compared its performance to other known kNN variants such as kd-tree and ball-tree. Our results clearly show the performance gains of the graph-based solution, while still being able to maintain or even reduce the positioning error.},

The notion of cognitive content-aware interference control is introduced, where the transmission pattern of cognitive nodes is dynamically adapted to the state of ``protected'' IoT data streams. The state describes the performance degradation that interference would cause to algorithms processing the data if the cognitive nodes would chose to transmit in the corresponding time period. The framework is instantiated for a case-study scenario where Device-to-Device and Long-Term Evolution communications coexist on the same channel resource. A city-monitoring application is considered, where the state captures the type of frames within a multimedia video stream processed at the edge of the network to detect and track objects.

  abstract = {A two-hop relay network is considered, in which an eavesdropper can overhear the relaying signal. To prevent the eavesdropper from decoding this signal, a destination transmits a jamming noise while a source transmits the data signal to the relay. At the same time, the relay can harvest energy from both the source signal and the jamming noise, and use this harvested energy to forward the received signal to the destination. In such a wireless-powered relay system with cooperative jamming, we propose two adaptive relaying schemes based on power splitting and time switching techniques. In the proposed power splitting-based relaying (PSR) and time switching-based relaying (TSR) schemes, the relay controls the power splitting ratio~($\rho$) and time switching ratio~($\alpha$), respectively, in order to achieve a balance between signal processing and energy harvesting. We find analytically the optimal values of $\rho$ and $\alpha$ in each scheme to maximize the secrecy capacity under the assumption of high signal-to-noise ratio. Interestingly, although the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) is used in the derivation of the optimal control parameters ($\rho$ and $\alpha$), they are shown not to be affected by the eavesdropper's CSI in a high SNR regime. This implies that the proposed schemes can be effective even for practical environments where there is no eavesdropper's CSI. Furthermore, simulation results show that they well coincide with the exact solutions in practical environments even though the closed-form solutions are obtained with a high SNR assumption. Moreover, the comparisons of PSR and TSR in various scenarios show that the two relaying schemes have complementary performances depending on the network conditions. Specifically, PSR achieves greater secrecy capacity than TSR when the channel condition is unfavourable to the eavesdropper for wiretapping.},

Based on the analysis, we found out that our solution has the most extensive set of performance features in comparison to related approaches found in the literature. The performance evaluation results show that compared to the existing approaches, the cryptographic key generation approach proposed in our end-to-end security scheme is on average 1.8~times faster than existing key generation approaches while being more energy-efficient. In addition, the scheme reduces the communication overhead by~26\% and the communication latency between smart gateways and end users by~16\%. Our scheme is also approximately 97\%~faster than certificate based and 10\%~faster that symmetric key-based DTLS. Certificate based DTLS requires about 2.9~times more ROM and 2.2~times more RAM resources.

Three approaches for distributing observation detection workload between sensing and processing devices are considered for sensor systems within wireless islands. Each of the approaches is formulated for the shared configuration of a sensor-edge system, in which the network structure, observation monitoring problem, and machine learning-based detector implementing it are not modified. For every approach, a high-level strategy for realization of the detector for different assumptions on the relation between its complexity and the system's constraints is considered. In each case, the potential for the constraints' satisfaction is shown to exist and be exploitable via division, approximation, and delegation of the detector's workload to the sensing devices off the edge processor. We present examples of applications that benefit from the proposed approaches.},

Hence, it can achieve up to 82\%~of the maximum energy saving and battery lifetime improvement possible by the ideal methodology where the future vehicle speed is known.},

  abstract = {We propose a low-latency approach for generating secure electrocardiogram (ECG) feature-based cryptographic keys. This is done by taking advantage of the uniqueness and randomness properties of ECG's main features. This approach achieves a low-latency since the key generation relies on four reference-free ECG's main features that can be acquired in short time. We call the approach several ECG features (SEF)-based cryptographic key generation. SEF consists of: 1)~detecting the arrival time of ECG's fiducial points using Daubechies wavelet transform to compute ECG's main features accordingly; 2)~using a dynamic technique to specify the optimum number of bits that can be extracted from each main ECG feature, comprising of PR, RR, PP, QT, and ST intervals; 3)~generating cryptographic keys by exploiting the above-mentioned ECG features; and 4)~consolidating and strengthening the SEF approach with cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators. Fibonacci linear feedback shift register and advanced encryption standard algorithms are implemented as the pseudo-random number generator to enhance the security level of the generated cryptographic keys. Our approach is applied to 239~subjects' ECG signals comprising of normal sinus rhythm, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, and myocardial infraction. The security analyses of the proposed approach are carried out in terms of distinctiveness, test of randomness, temporal variance, and using National Institute of Standards and Technology benchmark. The analyses reveal that the normal ECG rhythms have slightly better randomness compared with the abnormal ones. The analyses also show that the strengthened SEF key generation approach provides a higher security level in comparison to existing approaches that rely only on singleton ECG features. For the normal ECG rhythms, the SEF approach has in average the entropy of about~0.98 while cryptographic keys which are generated utilizing the strengthened SEF approach offer the entropy of~$\sim$1. The execution time required to generate the cryptographic keys on different processors is also examined. The results reveal that our SEF approach is in average 1.8~times faster than existing key generation approaches which only utilize the inter pulse interval feature of ECG.},

  abstract = {Energy management systems (EMS) are mainly price driven with minimal consumer interaction. To improve the effectiveness of EMS in the context of demand response, an alternative EMS control framework driven by resident behavior patterns is developed. Using hidden Markov modeling techniques, the EMS detects consumer behavior from real-time aggregate consumption and a pre-built dictionary of reference models. These models capture variations in consumer habits as a function of daily living activity sequence. Following a training period, the system identifies the best fit model which is used to estimate the current state of the resident. When a request to activate a time-shiftable appliance is made, the control agent compares grid signals, user convenience constraints, and the current consumer state estimate to predict the likelihood that the future aggregate load exceeds a consumption threshold during the operating cycle of the requested device. Based on the outcome, the control agent initiates or defers the activation request. Using three consumer reference models, a case study assessing EMS performance with respect to model detection, state estimation, and control as a function of consumer comfort and grid-informed consumption constraints is presented. A tradeoff analysis between comfort, consumption threshold, and appliance activation delay is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {By placing processing-capable devices at the edge of local wireless access networks, Edge Computing architectures have been recently proposed to connect mobile devices to computational power through a one-hop low-latency wireless link. In this paper, we propose a new design where edge assistance is used to control local data filtering at the mobile devices in bandwidth and energy constrained systems. We focus on real-time monitoring applications, where the video input from mobile devices is processed to centrally detect and recognize objects. The edge processor controls the activation and deactivation of local classifiers implemented by the mobile devices to remove useless portions of video frames. The objective is to adapt the video stream to time-varying bandwidth constraints, while minimizing the additional energy consumption introduced by local processing. To this end, an optimization problem is formulated for a loss function embodying the balance between the risk of violating the available bandwidth and the cost of overly-conservative data filtering. The edge assists the local decision by extracting parameters of the video, such as density of objects of interest in a frame, which influence the output of the sensor. Numerical results, obtained by performing a measurement campaign based on a real implementation, illustrate the tension between energy and bandwidth use for a Haar feature-based cascade classifier.},

Additionally, the most advanced Urban IoT services focus on real-time data processing, which shifts the perspective and goal of the network when transporting data. In this paper, the notion of Quality of Computing (QoC) is introduced to capture the level of support the communication infrastructure provides to this family of computation applications. In this context, we propose a dynamic network selection mechanism based on Software Defined Networks (SDN) designed to provide QoC in Urban IoT scenarios where the heterogeneous network resources are shared. The proposed mechanism dynamically assigns portions of data from IoT streams over licensed and unlicensed bands to guarantee QoC while minimizing cost of operations and licensed band occupation. Instrumental to our technique is the recently proposed edge-computing architecture, where computational resources placed at the edge of wireless access networks enable the interconnection of network management to processing. We consider a real-time monitoring scenario, where sensors transmit a video stream which is processed to identify and classify objects. The supporting wireless infrastructure consists of WiFi that operates in unlicensed frequency bands and cellular communication technology, Long Term Evolution (LTE) operating in licensed bands. We demonstrate the performance by means of real-world experiments on a testbed with WiFi and LTE networks built with hostapd and OpenAirInterface.},

The core of the proposed technique is a cooperative framework where local classifiers at the mobile nodes are dynamically crafted and updated based on the current state of the observed system, the global processing objective and the characteristics of the sensors and data streams. The edge processor plays a key role by establishing a link between content and operations within the distributed system. The local classifiers are designed to filter the data streams and provide only the needed information to the global classifier at the edge processor, thus minimizing bandwidth usage. However, the better the accuracy of these local classifiers, the larger the energy necessary to run them at the individual sensors. A formulation of the optimization problem for the dynamic construction of the classifiers under bandwidth and energy constraints is proposed and demonstrated on a synthetic example.},

For this scenario, an optimization problem is formulated aiming at the maximization of the D2D link's throughput under a constraint on the Peak Signal-to-Noise-Ratio of the video data stream. The resulting optimal policy focuses interference on specific packets within the video stream, and significantly increases the throughput achieved by the D2D link compared to an undifferentiated interference strategy. The optimal strategy is applied to a real-world video streaming application to further demonstrate the performance gain.},

One of the main contributions of this paper is the introduction of the notion of content-oriented cognitive interference control in heterogeneous local access networks supporting computing and data processing in the urban IoT. A network scenario where multiple communication technologies, such as Device-to-Device and Long Term Evolution (LTE), is considered. The focus of the present paper is on city monitoring applications, where a video data stream generated by a camera system is remotely processed to detect objects. The cognitive network paradigm is extended to dynamically shape the interference pattern generated by concurrent data streams and induce a packet loss trajectory compatible with video processing algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed cognitive transmission strategy enables a significant throughput increase of interfering applications for a target accuracy of the monitoring application.},

We present a unified model based on discrete-time Finite State Markov Chain to capture the dynamicity and variations in both the energy supply from solar irradiance and the energy demand from the application. In this paper, we exploit the temporal and spatial characteristics of solar energy and propose a deterministic profile with stochastic process to reflect the fluctuation due to unexpected weather condition. Optimal policy to maximize expected total QoS is derived from the presented model using a probabilistic dynamic programming approach. Compared to a state-of-the-art deterministic energy management framework, our proposed approach outperforms in term of QoS and energy sustainability (with less shutdown time) of the system.},

A complex network where terminals store packets in a finite buffer and implement a backoff-based random channel access protocol is considered. Minimal information is available for observation to the cognitive terminals, in the form of energy readings mapped to the number of transmitting nodes in each time instant. The entanglement of the transmission processes induced by interference and the filtering effect of packet buffering make this task particularly difficult. It is shown how, based on the estimated parameters, the cognitive terminals, operating in the same channel resource, can predict the transmission trajectories of the other nodes and devise smart transmission strategies controlling the interference generated to the network.},
